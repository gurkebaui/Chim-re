Simply put:
you give an ai controll over your pc and your only way to stop it is to press...
nah youll figure it out
or itll kill itself at some point

**Now the actual reason I created this**

it uses nested learning and the mamba ssm ai architecture to acheave continuose learning.
you can reinforcement train it using + and -
and you as well may use F9 to activate observatory learning (early beta | works like shit) and use F8 to switch back to reinforcement learninng
it theoreticly can remember stuff, create plans and much more (tho one would have to train this thin for years to acheave that)

**Usage**

Do as you wish and have fun
